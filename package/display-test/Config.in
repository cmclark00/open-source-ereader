	  E-Paper Display Test Application for Waveshare 4.2" display.

	  This application tests the Waveshare 4.2" e-paper display
	  by initializing the display via SPI and drawing "Hello E-Reader"
	  text using a basic bitmap font. It verifies that the hardware
	  and software stack are working correctly.

	  The application uses SPI device interface (/dev/spidev0.0) and
	  GPIO sysfs interface for display control signals (RST, DC, BUSY).
