	  GPIO Button Input Test Application for E-Reader.

	  This application tests the GPIO button input system by reading
	  button events from the Linux input subsystem (/dev/input/eventX)
	  and displaying them to the console. It verifies that the button
	  hardware and device tree configuration are working correctly.

	  The application uses the Linux input event interface (evdev) to
	  read button presses from the gpio-keys driver. It implements
	  software debouncing and provides color-coded console output for
	  easy verification.

	  Button Layout:
	    - UP (GPIO 5)     - Navigate up
	    - DOWN (GPIO 6)   - Navigate down
	    - SELECT (GPIO 13) - Confirm/Enter
	    - BACK (GPIO 19)   - Go back/Cancel
	    - MENU (GPIO 26)   - Open menu
