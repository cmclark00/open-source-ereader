    - HTTP/HTTPS download function (use libcurl or wget)
    - Progress tracking (bytes downloaded / total size)
    - Save to /books/ directory with proper filename
    - Validate downloaded file (check format, not corrupt)
  - Write `src/ereader/network/download_manager.h`
  - Add libcurl or wget to Buildroot packages

    - Browse pre-configured book catalogs (Project Gutenberg popular books)
    - Search by title or author (if API supports)
    - Display book info (title, author, size, format)
    - Download button with progress indicator
    - Navigate to "Downloads" folder after completion
  - Write `src/ereader/ui/library_browser.h`

  - Consider OTA updates:
    - Design update mechanism (download new rootfs, apply on reboot)
    - Security considerations (signed updates)
    - Document in `docs/architecture/OTA_UPDATES.md`
  - Or: defer OTA updates to Phase 7, just do time sync in Phase 6

- [ ] Build and test WiFi features:
  - Rebuild Buildroot with WiFi support
  - Test WiFi scanning, connection, disconnection

- [ ] Update documentation for WiFi features:
  - Update `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` with:
    - How to set up WiFi for the first time
    - How to browse and download books
    - How to manage WiFi connections
    - Troubleshooting WiFi issues
  - Update `docs/hardware/WIFI_SETUP.md` with antenna considerations
  - Update `docs/progress/PHASE_06_LOG.md` with completion notes
  - Create `docs/progress/PHASE_07_PLANNING.md` for final polish and release prep
