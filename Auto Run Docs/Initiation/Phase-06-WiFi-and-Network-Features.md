  - ⏸️ WiFi status icon in status bar: Deferred - requires status bar redesign (Phase 07)
  - 📝 NOTE: Password entry UI (text_input.c/h) is still TODO - currently shows placeholder text
    - Users can connect to open networks
    - Users can connect to saved networks with stored passwords
    - On-device password entry requires text_input implementation (next task)

- [ ] Implement simple text input system:
  - Create `src/ereader/ui/text_input.c` for entering WiFi passwords:
    - Display alphabet grid (A-Z, 0-9, symbols)
    - Navigate with UP/DOWN/SELECT buttons
    - Backspace, space, done buttons
    - Display entered text at top
  - Write `src/ereader/ui/text_input.h`
  - Test with WiFi password entry
  - Note: This is slow but functional for occasional use

- [ ] Add online book download feature:
  - Research public domain book sources:
    - Project Gutenberg FTP/HTTP access
    - Internet Archive e-book collection
    - Other open APIs for book downloads
  - Create `docs/research/BOOK_SOURCES.md` with available sources
  - Decide on initial implementation (pre-configured bookstore vs manual URL entry)

- [ ] Implement book download manager:
  - Create `src/ereader/network/download_manager.c` with:
    - HTTP/HTTPS download function (use libcurl or wget)
    - Progress tracking (bytes downloaded / total size)
    - Save to /books/ directory with proper filename
    - Validate downloaded file (check format, not corrupt)
  - Write `src/ereader/network/download_manager.h`
  - Add libcurl or wget to Buildroot packages
  - Handle errors: network timeout, disk full, invalid file

- [ ] Create online library browser UI:
  - Create `src/ereader/ui/library_browser.c` with:
    - Browse pre-configured book catalogs (Project Gutenberg popular books)
    - Search by title or author (if API supports)
    - Display book info (title, author, size, format)
    - Download button with progress indicator
    - Navigate to "Downloads" folder after completion
  - Write `src/ereader/ui/library_browser.h`
  - Add "Library" option to main menu
  - Consider: cache catalog locally to reduce network requests

- [ ] Add time synchronization and updates:
  - Add ntpd or chrony to Buildroot for time sync via NTP
  - Create `src/ereader/network/time_sync.c` to trigger sync when WiFi connects
  - Consider OTA updates:
    - Design update mechanism (download new rootfs, apply on reboot)
    - Security considerations (signed updates)
    - Document in `docs/architecture/OTA_UPDATES.md`
  - Or: defer OTA updates to Phase 7, just do time sync in Phase 6

- [ ] Build and test WiFi features:
  - Rebuild Buildroot with WiFi support
  - Test WiFi scanning, connection, disconnection
  - Test book download from Project Gutenberg
  - Create `docs/testing/WIFI_TESTING.md` with test procedures
  - Document network performance (download speeds, latency)

- [ ] Update documentation for WiFi features:
  - Update `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` with:
    - How to set up WiFi for the first time
    - How to browse and download books
    - How to manage WiFi connections
    - Troubleshooting WiFi issues
  - Update `docs/hardware/WIFI_SETUP.md` with antenna considerations
  - Update `docs/progress/PHASE_06_LOG.md` with completion notes
  - Create `docs/progress/PHASE_07_PLANNING.md` for final polish and release prep
