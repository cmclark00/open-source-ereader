Welcome to Your Open Source E-Reader!

Thank you for choosing this open-source e-reader project. This device is built on a Raspberry Pi Zero W with a Waveshare 4.2" e-paper display, running a custom Linux system built with Buildroot.

GETTING STARTED

This e-reader is designed for reading plain text (.txt) files. When you power on the device, you'll see a menu listing all available books. Use the buttons on the right side of the display to navigate and read.

BUTTON CONTROLS

In the Menu (Library View):
  UP button     - Move selection up (wraps to bottom)
  DOWN button   - Move selection down (wraps to top)
  SELECT button - Open the selected book
  BACK button   - Exit the application (not recommended during normal use)

In the Reading View:
  UP button     - Previous page
  DOWN button   - Next page
  SELECT button - Save bookmark at current page
  BACK button   - Return to library menu

ADDING BOOKS

To add your own books to the e-reader:

1. Power off the device
2. Remove the microSD card
3. Insert the card into your computer
4. Mount the Linux partition (the larger one, not the boot partition)
5. Navigate to the /books directory
6. Copy your .txt files into this directory
7. Safely eject the SD card
8. Insert it back into the Raspberry Pi
9. Power on the device

SUPPORTED FORMATS

Currently, only plain text (.txt) files are supported. The files should be:
  - Encoded in UTF-8 or ASCII
  - Maximum file size: 10 MB
  - Use standard line breaks (LF or CRLF)

Books with special characters, formatting, or non-standard encodings may not display correctly.

BOOKMARKS

The e-reader automatically remembers where you left off in each book. When you open a book you've read before, it will start at your last reading position. You can also explicitly save a bookmark by pressing the SELECT button while reading.

Bookmarks are saved to /etc/ereader/bookmarks.txt and persist across reboots.

TIPS FOR BEST EXPERIENCE

1. Text files with paragraph breaks display better than continuous text
2. Keep book titles short and descriptive (max 47 characters for clean display)
3. The display shows approximately 14 lines of text per page
4. Each line can display approximately 47 characters
5. E-paper displays are designed for low power consumption and are easy on the eyes

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Display: 400x300 pixels, 1-bit (black and white)
Font: 8x16 pixel fixed-width font
Visible text area: 18 lines × 50 characters (with margins)
Reading area: 14 lines (excluding status bar and hints)
Memory: Loads entire book into RAM (10 MB maximum per book)

CURRENT LIMITATIONS

This is Phase 3 of the e-reader development. Current limitations include:
  - Only .txt files are supported (no EPUB, PDF, or other formats yet)
  - No WiFi connectivity or online features
  - No text search or table of contents
  - No font size adjustment
  - No backlight control (display has no backlight)

These features are planned for future phases of development.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: No books appear in the menu
Solution: Ensure .txt files are in the /books directory. Files must have the .txt extension and be readable.

Problem: Book won't open
Solution: Check file size (must be under 10 MB) and encoding (should be UTF-8 or ASCII).

Problem: Text displays incorrectly
Solution: Ensure the file uses standard text encoding. Try re-saving the file as UTF-8 plain text.

Problem: Device won't turn on
Solution: Check power supply and ensure the microSD card is properly inserted.

PROJECT INFORMATION

This open-source e-reader project is designed to be hackable, educational, and accessible. The entire system is built from source code using Buildroot, and all components are open source.

For more information, source code, and documentation, visit the project repository or check the /home/ereader directory on the device.

ENJOY READING!

We hope you enjoy using this e-reader. Happy reading!
