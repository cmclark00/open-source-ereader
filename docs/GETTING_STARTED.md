# Getting Started with E-Reader Development

This guide will help you set up your development environment and start working on the open-source e-reader project.

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge Requirements
- Basic Linux command line skills
- Understanding of embedded systems (helpful but not required)
- C/C++ programming (for software development)
- Electronics basics (for hardware work)
- Git version control

### Hardware for Development
At minimum, you'll need:
- A Linux PC (or VM with Ubuntu/Debian)
- 50GB+ free disk space (for build tools and SDKs)
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB recommended)
- SD card reader

Optional but recommended:
- Development board (see recommendations below)
- USB serial adapter (for debugging)
- Multimeter (for hardware debugging)

## Development Paths

Choose your area of focus:

### Path A: Software Development (OS and Applications)
Start here if you want to work on the OS, bootloader, or reader application.

### Path B: Hardware Development (PCB and Case Design)
Start here if you want to design the circuit board and physical device.

### Path C: Full Stack (Both Hardware and Software)
The complete experience - design everything from scratch.

## Path A: Software Development Setup

### Step 1: Install Required Tools

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git build-essential gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf \
  libncurses5-dev bc wget cpio unzip rsync qemu-system-arm \
  device-tree-compiler u-boot-tools
```

On Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel git arm-none-eabi-gcc qemu-system-arm \
  uboot-tools dtc
```

### Step 2: Install Buildroot

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot
cd buildroot
git checkout 2024.02  # Use latest stable LTS version
```

### Step 3: Get a Development Board

For initial development, use an off-the-shelf board similar to our target:

**Recommended Development Boards**:

1. **Orange Pi Zero** ($15-20)
   - Allwinner H2+/H3 SoC
   - 256/512MB RAM options
   - Good Linux support
   - Cheap and available

2. **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** ($15)
   - More powerful than needed
   - Excellent documentation
   - Easy to get started
   - Not cost-effective for production

3. **Lichee Pi Nano** ($10-15)
   - Allwinner F1C100s
   - Very minimal (32MB RAM)
   - Ultra-low cost
   - Good for testing minimal builds

4. **Pine64 A64-LTS** ($20)
   - More powerful Allwinner A64
   - Good mainline support
   - Good for PDF-heavy testing

**Recommendation**: Start with Orange Pi Zero for best balance.

### Step 4: Get an E-Ink Display

**Starter Option**: Waveshare e-Paper displays with SPI interface
- 4.2" (400x300): ~$20
- 5.83" (600x448): ~$25
- 7.5" (800x480): ~$35

Most Waveshare displays work with Raspberry Pi and can be adapted to other SBCs.

### Step 5: Build Your First Image

```bash
cd ~/buildroot

# Start with a known configuration
make raspberrypi0w_defconfig  # or orangepi_zero_defconfig

# Customize configuration
make menuconfig

# Build (this takes 30-60 minutes first time)
make -j$(nproc)
```

The output will be in `output/images/`

### Step 6: Flash and Boot

```bash
# Flash to SD card (replace /dev/sdX with your SD card)
sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
sync
```

Insert SD card into board and boot!

### Step 7: Connect and Test

```bash
# Serial connection (if using USB-to-serial adapter)
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

# Or SSH (if network is configured)
ssh root@<board-ip>
```

## Path B: Hardware Development Setup

### Step 1: Install EDA Software

**For PCB Design** - Choose one:

1. **KiCad** (Recommended - Open Source)
   ```bash
   sudo apt install kicad kicad-libraries
   ```

2. **EasyEDA** (Web-based, integrates with JLCPCB)
   - Visit https://easyeda.com/

### Step 2: Install 3D Design Software

**For Case Design** - Choose one:

1. **FreeCAD** (Open Source)
   ```bash
   sudo apt install freecad
   ```

2. **Fusion 360** (Free for hobbyists)
   - Download from Autodesk

3. **OpenSCAD** (Programmatic CAD)
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openscad
   ```

### Step 3: Study Reference Designs

Look at existing open hardware e-readers:
- Pocketbook schematics (if available)
- reMarkable teardowns
- Kindle hardware analyses
- Inkplate (ESP32-based e-ink device)

### Step 4: Start with Block Diagram

Before schematic, create a system block diagram:
- Power tree
- SoC connections
- Display interface
- Input/output

### Step 5: Begin Schematic Design

Start with the reference design for your chosen SoC:
- Allwinner has reference designs
- Use manufacturer's recommended circuits
- Follow power sequencing requirements

## Path C: Full Stack Setup

Follow both Path A and Path B setup instructions above.

## Next Steps After Setup

1. **Join the Community** (when established)
   - Discord/Matrix chat
   - GitHub Discussions
   - Mailing list

2. **Check the Issue Tracker**
   - Look for "good first issue" labels
   - Find something that matches your skills

3. **Start Small**
   - Get a dev board booting
   - Blink an LED
   - Display something on e-ink
   - Read a button press

4. **Document Your Progress**
   - Take notes
   - Share what you learn
   - Help improve documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Make sure you have enough disk space (50GB+)
- Check build prerequisites are installed
- Try `make clean` and rebuild

### Board Won't Boot
- Check SD card is properly flashed
- Verify power supply (5V, 2A minimum)
- Connect serial console to see boot messages
- Try known-good SD card image first

### Display Not Working
- Check SPI connections
- Verify voltage levels (3.3V vs 5V)
- Test with manufacturer's example code first
- Use logic analyzer to debug SPI signals
