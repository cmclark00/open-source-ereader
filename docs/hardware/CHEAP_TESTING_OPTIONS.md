# Cheap Testing Options

Budget-friendly alternatives for initial prototyping and software development.

## Problem: Initial Costs Too High

If the recommended components are more expensive than expected:
- Orange Pi Zero LTS: $35 (should be ~$22)
- 5.83" e-ink: $63 (should be ~$30)

**Total**: ~$100 instead of expected $60

This happens due to:
- Stock shortages
- Third-party seller markups
- Regional pricing differences
- Shipping costs included in price

## Solution: Cheaper Testing Path

### Option 1: Smaller Waveshare Display (RECOMMENDED)

Use a tiny display just to validate the software stack works.

#### Waveshare 2.13" E-Paper Display

**Price**: $15-18 on Amazon
**Resolution**: 250x122
**Interface**: Same SPI as larger displays
**Size**: Tiny, but proves concept

**Why it's perfect for testing**:
- ✅ Same driver architecture as larger displays
- ✅ Same SPI interface
- ✅ Same software stack
- ✅ Proves your code works
- ✅ 1/3 the price
- ✅ Fast shipping

**What you can test**:
- Linux boots and runs
- SPI communication works
- Display refresh cycles
- Button input handling
- Power management
- Reading app basics

**What you can't test**:
- Actual reading experience (too small)
- Final form factor
- Real battery life

**Strategy**:
1. Buy 2.13" display for $18
2. Prove software works
3. Later upgrade to 6" display when cheaper/available

#### Waveshare 2.9" E-Paper Display

**Price**: $18-22 on Amazon
**Resolution**: 296x128
**Size**: Slightly bigger, more readable

**Slightly better than 2.13"** but still tiny for actual reading.

---

#### Waveshare 4.2" E-Paper Display

**Price**: $22-28 on Amazon
**Resolution**: 400x300
**Size**: Small but actually usable for reading

**Sweet spot for testing**:
- Large enough to read a few lines of text
- Tests real reading scenarios
- Still cheaper than 6"
- Same software architecture

**Recommendation**: If budget allows, this is the best testing size.

### Option 2: Raspberry Pi Zero W Instead of Orange Pi

If Orange Pi is $35 (too expensive), consider:

#### Raspberry Pi Zero W (Not Zero 2)

**Price**: $10-15 (if you can find it)
**Specs**: Single-core, 512MB RAM
**Why**: Cheaper, easier to find

**Pros**:
- Much cheaper
- Excellent documentation
- Huge community
- Easy software setup

**Cons**:
- Often out of stock
- May need to buy from bundles
- Single-core (slower)
- Still works fine for testing

---

#### Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

**Price**: $15-25
**Specs**: Quad-core, 512MB RAM
**Why**: More available than Zero W

**Better performance** than Orange Pi Zero for only slightly more.

If Orange Pi is $35, the Pi Zero 2 W at $20-25 is actually a better deal!

---

### Option 3: Use What You Have

#### Do You Already Have Any SBC?

**Compatible boards**:
- Any Raspberry Pi (1, 2, 3, 4, Zero)
- Any Orange Pi model
- Banana Pi
- Rock Pi
- Most ARM single-board computers

**For testing, you can use**:
- Your old Raspberry Pi from a drawer
- Any Linux-capable SBC
- Even an old Android phone with Linux deploy

**Why it works**:
- Just testing SPI communication
- Display driver is portable
- Can move to final hardware later

---

### Phase 2: Wait for Better Prices

**While working on software**, watch for:
- Orange Pi Zero back in stock at $18-22
- 6" display deals (< $35)
- Sales / discounts

**Or order from AliExpress**:
- Orange Pi official: $15
- 5.83" or 6" display: $20-28
- Ships while you're coding
- Arrives in 2-4 weeks

---

### Phase 3: Build Final Device

**When ready and prices better**:
- Order 6" display
- Order final components
- Build production version

**Total saved**: $20-30 by not rushing

---

## Alternative: Simulator/Emulator First

### No Hardware Needed Initially

**Use QEMU** to emulate:
```bash
# Emulate ARM system
qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 ...

# Test display in virtual framebuffer
# Develop reading app
# Test all software
```

**Then buy hardware** when:
- Software mostly working
- Prices better
- You're sure it'll work

**Saves**: All upfront costs until you're confident
