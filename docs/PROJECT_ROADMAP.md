**Success Criteria**:
- Can open and read common e-book formats
- Battery lasts >1 week with normal use
- UI is responsive and intuitive

## Phase 3: Hardware Design

**Duration**: 8-12 weeks (can overlap with Phase 2)

**Goals**:
- Design custom PCB schematic
- Layout PCB (2 or 4 layer)
- Design 3D printed case
- Order PCB prototypes
- Source components
- Assemble first prototype

**Deliverables**:
- PCB design files (KiCad)
- 3D case models (STL files)
- Assembly instructions
- Testing procedures

**Success Criteria**:
- Prototype hardware boots and runs OS
- All components function correctly
- Form factor is usable
- Cost target met (~$50 in parts)

## Phase 4: Software Refinement

**Duration**: 6-8 weeks

**Goals**:
- Optimize boot time (<5 seconds)
- Improve battery life
- Add advanced features (dictionary, annotations, etc.)
- Implement WiFi connectivity (if included)
- Create user documentation
- Test on actual hardware

**Deliverables**:
- Optimized OS image
- Feature-complete reader application
- User manual
- Developer documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- Boot time under 5 seconds
- Battery lasts 3-4 weeks with typical use
- All planned features working
- Stable and reliable

## Phase 5: Testing and Iteration

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks

**Goals**:
- Beta testing with users
- Fix bugs and issues
- Improve hardware design based on feedback
- Optimize software performance
- Prepare for wider release

**Deliverables**:
- Revised hardware design (Rev 2)
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Testing reports
- Build instructions

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical bugs
- Positive user feedback
- Hardware reliable
- Reproducible build process

## Phase 6: Community Release

**Duration**: Ongoing

**Goals**:
- Release all designs and code
- Create detailed build guides
- Establish community channels
- Support builders and developers
- Iterate based on community feedback

**Deliverables**:
- Complete open-source release
- Build guides and videos
- Community forum/chat
- Component sourcing guide

**Success Criteria**:
- Others successfully build the device
- Active community engagement
- Ongoing improvements

## Long-term Goals

### Hardware Evolution
- Larger display options (7.8", 10")
- Color e-ink support
- Improved CPU options
- Better battery technology
- Frontlight integration
- Audio support (audiobooks, TTS)

### Software Features
- Syncing between devices
- Cloud storage integration
- Advanced note-taking
- OCR for scanned documents
- Translation features
- Accessibility improvements
- Alternative reading apps

### Ecosystem
- App store or package manager
- Third-party application support
- Plugin system
- Multiple UI themes
- Localization (multiple languages)

## Current Status

**We are in Phase 0: Planning and Research**

Next immediate steps:
1. Review and finalize hardware component selection
2. Order development board for prototyping
3. Set up Buildroot development environment
4. Begin work on Phase 1 proof of concept

## Contributing

We need help in multiple areas:
- **Hardware**: PCB design, component selection, case design
- **Kernel**: Display driver development, power management
- **Software**: Reader app, UI design, document rendering
- **Documentation**: User guides, build instructions, tutorials
- **Testing**: Hardware testing, software QA, battery life tests

See CONTRIBUTING.md (coming soon) for how to get involved.

## Timeline Summary

```
Month 0-1:   Planning and Research [CURRENT]
Month 1-3:   Proof of Concept
Month 3-6:   Core Software + Hardware Design [Parallel]
Month 6-8:   Software Refinement
Month 8-10:  Testing and Iteration
Month 10+:   Community Release and Ongoing Development
```

**Estimated time to working prototype**: 6-8 months
**Estimated time to community release**: 10-12 months

This timeline assumes part-time development effort. With more contributors or full-time work, this could be accelerated significantly.
